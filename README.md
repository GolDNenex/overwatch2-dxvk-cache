# Overwatch2 dxvk-cache (Not compatible with dxvk-async) 

Download the latest release of [overwatch.dxvk-cache](https://github.com/GolDNenex/overwatch2-dxvk-cache/raw/main/Overwatch.dxvk-cache)

## How to use it:


The location for placing the file will depend on whether you used the lutris script to install battle.net or overwatch 1. If you use a custom path, change accordingly.

If you use the overwatch 1 script:
```
~/Games/overwatch
```
If you use the battle.net script:

```
~/Games/battlenet
```
If you already start the game and have the dxvk-cache file you just need to replace the old one with the previously downloaded one.

In the end your folder should look like that:
